Write a program in C to read 10 numbers from the keyboard and find their sum and average.
Test Data :
Input the 10 numbers :
Number-1 :2
...
Number-10 :2
Expected Output :
The sum of 10 no is : 55
The Average is : 5.500000

solution :


#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
   int n;
   int sum;
   float average;
   int count = 0;

   for (int i = 0; i <= 9; i++){
        printf("number-%d: ", count +1);
        scanf("%d", &n);
        sum += n;
        average = sum / 10;
        count ++ ;

   }
   printf("the sum of 10 no is: %d\n", sum);
   printf("the Average is : %f", average);

   return 0;
}
